# clip-identity-extraction
Extract names of individuals from CLIP given only images.

Code coming soon:
- Extract names via REINFORCE using a language model + any exemplar image.
- Perform extraction by selection for a small set of CLIP image / name features.

We do not plan to release the datasets (VGGFace2 + names from wikipedia).
